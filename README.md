## 📂 Featured Projects

- 🔁 **CI/CD Orchestration with Jenkins + Kubernetes**  
  Built a WebSocket-integrated Jenkins pipeline that dynamically tests user-submitted code in Kubernetes namespaces, then deploys to production on success.

- ☸️ **Kubernetes-Based Code Execution Platform**  
  Architected a namespace-isolated system that spins up pods for each commit, runs automated tests, and handles promotion to production based on results.

- 🚀 **CI/CD Automation with GitHub Actions**  
  Created a GitHub Actions pipeline that auto-creates a feature branch, runs tests on each push, merges to `main` on success, and deploys to production automatically.

- 🛠️ **CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins**  
  Replicated the above pipeline using Jenkins—handling branch creation, testing, merging, and automated production deployment through scripted stages.

- 🧰 **Server Provisioning with Ansible**  
  Automated server setup from scratch using Ansible playbooks to install packages, configure firewalls, deploy applications, and enable secure access.

- 📦 **Microservices Deployment with Docker & Traefik**  
  Containerized a multi-service TODO app (Vue, Go, Spring Boot, Node.js, Python) with Traefik managing routing and SSL in a Docker Compose setup.
